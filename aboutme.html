          <p class="regtext"> Hi! My name is Tam. I am a software engineer turned couples counselor turned software engineer again. Originally, I worked for Hewlett Packard, Cisco Systems, and a little startup named Passage Systems. A few years ago, I left coding to become licensed as a marriage and family therapist and work as a couples counselor for LGBT couples. I really enjoyed it immensely, and met some really awesome people, but I missed using the other side of my brain. So when the opportunity came up to go back to software, I jumped at it. Right now, I'm catching up on what I missed by attending DevBootCamp in San Francisco.

            Outside of work, and playing with my two beautiful girls, I love to dance, particularly International Latin Ballroom. Rumba, Cha-Cha, Samba, Paso Doble, Jive, love them all. Well, I don't love the jive yet. Not yet... but the day is still young.
