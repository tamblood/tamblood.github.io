		<p class="textofblog">Today I will analyze three websites for their user experience and design: Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn and Munchery.

                First, Restoration Hardware. When I first enter the site, I am instantly drawn to the first main image which has much openness and light, making the site seem deeper visually. The color palette is consistent, and is not jarring. There is plenty of whitespace which is also very calming. The visual effect is calming, organized, soothing, beautiful and settled. Everything seems to be in its place. This site sells furniture, and the content is aspirational, mouth watering, engaging, jealousy inducing and ordered. It is incredibly easy to find what you are looking for. By hovering over the top nav bar you can see all the content of the site and easily click to what you are looking for. The color palette of the entire site is easy to digest. I feel calm and happy while looking at the site. I have purchased a lot of things from this site, most of which have made me very happy ( I still question that apothecary lamp a few years back, but some folks really like it. )

                Secondly, Pottery Barn. I like this site because I love furniture. When entering the site, my eye is drawn to the image on the homepage, but this image changes constantly until you click on it, which is very distracting. This area does not seem to convey the most important aspect of the site. Visually, the site is cluttered, flashy, hyper, and crammed full of stuff and seems to have too much information. The content is practical, but the color palette is unfocused, which adds to the jarring effect of the content which is unengaging. The site is difficult to navigate, as two different nav bars navigate in different ways. When hovering over the nav bar, the white backdrop is jarring. I feel anxious after spending time on this site, and as though I have wasted time. I have bought products from Pottery Barn in the store, but rarely from this site.

                Thirdly, Munchery. I like this site because it is soothing. On the homepage, I am drawn to the middle icon which has lots of space and appears to have an ecru background color, which I find soothing to the eye. Visually, the site is well branded, minimalist, organized, easy. This site sells delivered meals. The content is practical, aspirational, engaging and informative. It is an extremely easy to browse site, by scrolling down you can see pictures of all the items for sale. The nav bar on top is easy to use. After being on this site for awhile, I feel content but very hungry. I have bought lots of items from this site, but had to stop because it gets pricey.
