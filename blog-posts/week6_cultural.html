		<p class="textofblog">I'll never forget my first corporate job, right out of college. I didn't realize it then, but I was reacting to stereotype threat. I didn't show any emotion whatsoever. I thought that's what they wanted, since I thought women were seen as too emotional. I imagine they thought I was a robot. The one time I made a joke, my mentor nearly fell over, he couldn't believe I had said it. It goes without saying that in the face of stereotype threat in that situation, I shut down parts of myself to avoid confirming what I thought were negative stereotypes.
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">As I'm thinking about it now, I am realizing that there are ways in which stereotype threat could affect me at DevBootCamp. My gender, my race, my age are all possiblities that had not really become apparent until now. I find it comforting that probably most folks feel some form of this or another flavor of it. And, looking at the pictures of my cohorts, we appear to have a pretty diverse group which helps. I will probably not be the "only one" of any particular subset. I do not anticipate having queues thrown at me which would emphasize a particular identity. Since we are being asked to blog about stereotype threat, it's clear that DevBootCamp is aware of this issue and has probably thought about it a lot.
        </p>
        <p class="textofblog">So what can we do? I think we can and should talk about it. Is anyone experiencing stereotype threat? If so, how? What can we do to make everyone's experience better? I think making it part of our language and normalizing it can have very powerful consequences. More importantly, we can be aware of it. We can notice what queues we are giving others. We can be open when others let us know what is affecting them. We can notice what other people do or say that affects us. And in the grand notion of a big experiment, we can endeavor to talk about these things, and try to make our experiment just a little bit better.
