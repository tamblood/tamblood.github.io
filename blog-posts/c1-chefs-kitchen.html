		<p class="textofblog">I see DBC as much more of a 9 week sprint than I did before, with the prep work as training for that sprint. My expectations have changed in that I didn't realize how much time overall would be expected. I am definitely both nervous and excited equally. I like that the expectation is to take charge of your own learning. I particularly like the kitchen analogy and remembering when I feel entitled, and when I feel like just fixing it myself.
