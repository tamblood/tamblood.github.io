		<p class="textofblog">Today, let's look at the problem of organizational structure in high tech companies. Many high tech companies inherited their organizational structure from other types of business. Most have ended up with hierarchical, decentralized, product-centric or a matrix model. The problem with inheriting any type of structure from a different type of business is that the tech industry changes so quickly, it is difficult to put in place a structure that is most effective for both today's challenges as well as tomorrow's. What worked yesterday may not be the best solution for tomorrow. Often, companies which are larger realize this at great expense and create "reorganizations" of the company's structure. 
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Often, structure is put in place to keep employees from doing things they shouldn't be doing. This is often where hierarchical structures work well, keeping the roles and expectations clear for each team. However, this can lead to a mentality of "that's not my job", or worse yet, playing hot potato with difficult tasks or issues and trying to force other teams to take on the issues. This is a horizontal issue, but there can be vertical issues as well. If front line employees do not have faith in the directives sent down by managers, this also can cause a loss in productivity. Often, high tech companies are very focused on the "what" but not the "how" of the process. As a company grows, it can be very difficult to maintain the focus and efficiency that existed as a small startup. 
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">I would imagine that any structure can have its pros and cons, but perhaps instead of thinking about changing the structure to solve a problem, we look at the roots of the problem instead. The problems caused by inefficient structures are worker disillusionment, lack of focus and productivity loss due to teams not working well together.
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">What we might want to envision is a different kind of relationship between management and employee, between visionary and function role, between the lowest and the highest rungs on the ladder. What if, during the hiring process, only people who were motivated by the same priorities as the company were hired? Of course, this is only an ideal, but worth considering. It's much easier to find folks who believe in what you believe in already, than to convince them it's true. I suggest that the first day for any employee involve a short conversation with the CEO about expectation, vision, and values. This sets the tone from day one that what each person does at each level matters. I also suggest that 360 communication be considered, so that each person has an opportunity to improve the process. Of course, none of this happens without employee buyin. To achieve this, I suggest showing a clear and direct line between company success and employee reward in the form of bonuses and merit awards based on company success. If all the oars are rowing in the same direction, the boat will follow. If all employees are engaged and focused on the priorities of the company, this creates a culture that the best talent will want to be and stay a part of.
