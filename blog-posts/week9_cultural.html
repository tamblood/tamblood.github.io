		<p class="textofblog">A good question has many parts that make it a good question. But overall and foremost, is the intention behind the question. A good question has been researched, thought about, chewed upon, and all other resources exhausted before asking. A good question is specific. A good question is well intentioned. A good question is a delight to answer. To find a good question to ask, think of a good question to answer. A good question to answer is one asked in a way that makes it easy to answer it. It is specific, well researched, and asked by someone who most likely has a good track record of asking good questions.
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">While that last bit may sound a bit circular, it is in fact the key to learning to ask great questions. In essence, when we ask questions, we are building our reputation for either asking good questions, or asking 'not so great' questions. No one minds answering a question from someone who asks great questions.
