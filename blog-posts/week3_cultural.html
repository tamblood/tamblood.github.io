		<p class="textofblog">I am looking at my Gregorc Thinking Style scores:
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Concrete Sequential: 32
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Abstract Sequential: 40
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Abstract Random: 28
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Concrete Random: 20
        </p>
        <p class="textofblog">So from this I learned that I favor Abstract Sequential thinking style, but clearly I have a preference for sequential over random. Abstract Sequential crave structure, and prefer taking in information bit by bit in order. They prefer to read for information, to work alone, and be prepared for class. Abstract Sequential thinkers struggle with open ended assignments, struggle with games, and do not enjoy online classes that do not provide exact instructions. They also tend to have high standards and are often critical of their own work.

        <p class="textofblog">The two most difficult challenges for me while in DevBootCamp phase 0 were the chrome dev tools challenge and the html5 reading challenge. In the chrome dev tools challenge, I was technically out of my league, which was very unsettling. I spent a lot of time talking myself down, and finding other easier resources to help me, and repeating the challenge ( 4 times so far ). I still don't quite get it, but I do understand what makes it so difficult.  In the html5 reading challenge, I felt unclear how far or how deeply I needed to cover the material. I found myself struggling, and used up a lot of energy trying to figure out 'should I be reading this now?' instead of learning anything. 
		</p>
        <p class="textofblog">I have learned that it is difficult for me when I don't feel prepared, and when I am not sure what to do, either from not understanding the technical information or not understanding the directions. I know when I am really out of my comfort zone when I feel totally unprepared and lost. My action plan to address this is to create internal structure for myself when I cannot find external structure, by remembering my ultimate goals. I can think about 'what is it that we are learning?' and 'how does this fit into the bigger picture of web development?' When I don't feel prepared, I can remind myself that this is an exercise in building different muscles. When I become overwhelmed, I can remember to what works well and is my preferred thinking style, such as returning to reading or videos that I do understand about the topic.
