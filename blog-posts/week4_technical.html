		<p class="textofblog">The ruby enumerable class gives us many ways to work with collections. Today, let's look at the Enumerable:cycle method. In the simplest sense, cycle gives us a way to continually yield the elements of an object to a code block over and over. Cycle also has an optional argment, which specifies how many times the elements should be yielded to a code block. This in effect gives us a way to have a nested loop. 
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">For example, if we create a small ruby program like so:
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/cycle_code_4.png" /> 
        <p class="textofblog">We see that cycle loops over the elements of array 4 times, as instructed:
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/cycle_output_4.png" /> 
        <p class="textofblog">However, if we leave off the argument, cycle loops indefinitely, as we can see from taking out the argument of 4:
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/cycle_code_infinity.png" /> 
        <p class="textofblog">This produces an unending loop of numbers on our screen:
        </p>
        <img src="../imgs/cycle_output_infinity.png" /> 
        <p class="textofblog">Which we can only stop by hitting Control-c 
		</p>
        <img src="../imgs/cycle_output_infinity2.png" /> 
        <p class="textofblog">We could also add code which would break out of the loop as well.
