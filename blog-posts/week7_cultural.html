		<p class="textofblog">Values that come to the top for me:
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Accomplishment
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Courage
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Decisiveness
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Inspiration
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Physical Challenge
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Self-respect
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Wisdom
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Accomplishment has always been important to me. If you are not moving in a positive direction, then you are moving in a negative one. There is no staying in one place.
        </p>
        <p class="textofblog">In general, I try to live up to these values - to the best of my ability. The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was a friend of a fellow boot who was considering a career change into something I used to do.
		</p>
        <p class="textofblog">When I think about my values, I feel strong and centered. I think it can mediate stereotype threat to remember these values. Whenever I am down about a project I am undertaking, such as DBC, it helps me to remember why I am doing this, and the bigger picture. I want a better life, more flexibility, a better standard of living for my family, and hopefully more bathrooms in my house someday. I am trying to learn skills in order to get there. I may not learn everything, but hopefully learn enough to meet my goals. If I stress about how hard it is for me to learn something, this actually gets in the way of my learning. I need to remember to take a break, get up, get some fresh air and remember to (in Jay Bobo's words) - Drop it like it's hot! This is supposed to be an enjoyable experience, and designed to teach me a lot. Trust the process. Stay awake. Learn. Enjoy it.
