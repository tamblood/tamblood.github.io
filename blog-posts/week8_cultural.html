		<p class="textofblog">Conflict is never an easy thing to deal with, but learning conflict management strategies can be very helpful. The last conflict I had involved a friend of mine. I had asked my friend to give me a ride home after an outpatient procedure. The doctor's office wanted to ensure my safety by making sure someone accompanied me home, as I was not allowed to drive for a few hours. My friend forgot to pick me up. This was in no way an insurmountable obstacle, I live in a city and there are many ways home. However, it was complicated by my doctor's policy of needing to be accompanied by a specific person in order to be allowed to leave. 
        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">My first reaction was to try to let it go. I imagined that my friend had an emergency, or some other reason that made it impossible to be there. After I found out that it was simply forgetfulness, I became angry. After I calmed down a bit, I called my friend back to ask for a time we could talk. We talked for a long time, and I explained how disappointed I felt, and how disrespected. I talked about the trust I had placed in my friend, and how that had been temporarily broken. I listened to my friend's reactions, and heartfelt apology. I am glad that I went ahead and asked to talk to my friend instead of just letting it go, and being kind of angry over time. I think it made the situation much better to feel heard, and to state how I felt, and to make time for that.
        </p>
        <p class="textofblog">If I could go back in time, I probably would have reminded my friend that day or the day before about my request to pick me up. I learned a valuable lesson though, that our friendship was actually made stronger by going through this process of disappointment and conflict resolution. I learned that it is much better for me to speak up when my feelings are hurt instead of just trying to brush it off. I end up feeling better in the long run, even though my tendency is to withdraw in the face of conflict, I gain more by dealing with it directly.
