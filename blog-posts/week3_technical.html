        </p>
		<p class="textofblog">Advantages 
        </p>
        <p class="textofblog">JavaScript is easy to learn, and there is no compiling required since it is an interpreted language. Code can be developed in simple editors such as NotePad. Most impressive to end users, JavaScript causes results to appear on the web page very quickly, since no calls to the server are needed. The results of changes can be seen by simply reloading the web page. JavaScript is available on most browsers, and is one of the most popular programming languages.

        <p class="textofblog">Disadvantages
        </p>
        <p class="textofblog">The disadvantages of JavaScript are more apparent as we look closer into a full use of the language. There is not strong support for file access, so creating or reading or writing from files is a challenge. In addition, it is difficult to directly work with printers. Multithreaded programming, or having many streams of processing at once, is not supported. JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that there is flexibility in the inputs, and JavaScript will sort out what you mean by what you typed. However, there are sometimes surprising results with this. For security issues, some people turn off JavaScript, which means that pages with JavaScript may not render properly. Also, JavaScript is not fully search engine friendly, since the JavaScript code is not in a form that search bots can easily read.
