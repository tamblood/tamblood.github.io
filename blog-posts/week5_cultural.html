		<p class="textofblog">Pair programming - here is something I have not done a lot of in the past. I had a wide spectrum of experiences while pairing with other programmers. If I felt like my knowledge was much less than my pair, I felt embarassed and afraid to be holding us up. If I felt my knowledge was much more than my pair, at times I felt like the session was more beneficial to my pair than to me. Perhaps that is the ebb and flow of pairing, at times you are helping your pair, and at times your pair is the one that helps you. The most fun pairings were the ones in which my pair and I were evenly matched in experience, and I felt comfortable with the material. That made any challenge much more enjoyable, even if we ran into roadblocks. The most frustrating thing for me was running into a problem I didn't know how to solve, and my pair didn't either, and us both spending a lot of time on it, until I felt really fuzzy. When I feel really fuzzy, I feel guilty that I am not able to focus 100%.

		<p class="textofblog">I felt glad overall when I read my feedback, since it appeared that my pairs recognized how hard I work to be a good pair. I also felt sad when anyone would rate me less than 100% on 'would happily pair with Tam again.' That kind of hurt my feelings, who wouldn't want to pair with me?! Yet I understand. I also felt sad when rated less than always 100% on 'felt motivated and inspired by'. I guess those two categories seem kind of personal to me. I also noticed that the feedback may have been more positive when my knowledge was more than my pair, and less positive when my pair was more knowledgeable than me on that topic. Writing feedback was hard, because I felt I had to come up with something to be constructively critical about, and sometimes I couldn't find anything. Other times, I had an idea, but struggled with how to say it in a kind way. Based on the feedback, I will plan to be as prepared and as knowledgeable about the topic as I can, since this seems to effect my pair's experience.

        <p class="textofblog">Overall, I think pairing and giving feedback is one way to guide learning. I think it keeps me honest about my interactions. Pairing is sometimes challenging, since sometimes I think, 'this would be so much easier to do myself!' But it is also a good skill to learn. A well matched pair can teach you a lot, and it gives an opportunity to teach others in order to solidify concepts.
